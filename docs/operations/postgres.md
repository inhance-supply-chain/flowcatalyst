# PostgreSQL

The platform holds all state in Postgres — tenants, IAM, events, dispatch jobs, audit logs, OAuth tokens. This document covers provisioning, sizing, migrations, partitioning, and credential management.

## Version and extensions

| Item | Requirement |
|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | 14 or newer. Tested on 14/15/16/17. Should work on 18+ given driver support. |
| Extensions | None required. |

We deliberately avoid `pg_partman`, `pg_cron`, and other extensions. RDS allowlists move on AWS's schedule, not ours, and `pg_partman_bgw` was already dropped from the RDS PG 18 allowlist between two RDS releases. Our partition manager runs in pure Rust (see [../architecture/partitioning.md](../architecture/partitioning.md)) — same behaviour in dev (fc-dev's embedded PG) and prod (RDS, self-hosted, anything).

## Provisioning

### Self-hosted

```sh
createdb flowcatalyst
createuser -P flowcatalyst_app
psql -c "GRANT ALL ON DATABASE flowcatalyst TO flowcatalyst_app"
psql -d flowcatalyst -c "GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO flowcatalyst_app"
```

That's it. Migrations run at platform startup; no manual schema setup needed.

### AWS RDS (typical production)

Minimum recommended starting size:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Engine | PostgreSQL 16 (or newer) |
| Instance | `db.t4g.medium` (light) → `db.m7g.large` (steady prod) |
| Storage | gp3, 100 GB initial, autoscale enabled |
| Multi-AZ | yes |
| Backup retention | 7 days minimum |
| Performance Insights | enabled |
| Parameter group | default, with `max_connections` raised to at least 200 |

Right-sizing comes down to event throughput:

| Events/sec sustained | Instance class (rough) |
|---|---|
| ≤ 50 | t4g.medium |
| 50–500 | m7g.large |
| 500–2k | m7g.xlarge with provisioned IOPS |
| 2k+ | m7g.2xlarge+, consider read-replica for the read models |

Storage grows roughly 1 KB per event (write model) + 2 KB per event (read model with denormalised columns) + 0.5 KB per dispatch attempt. A workload of 100 events/sec averaging 3 subscriptions = 300 dispatch jobs/sec = ~30 GB/day before retention drops kick in. At 90-day retention (the partition manager default) that's ~2.7 TB steady-state — plan accordingly.

### Connection limits

The platform uses two pools:

- **Main pool** (`fc-server` API + scheduler): `max_connections` configurable, default 20.
- **Stream processor pool**: 4 connections, separate from the main pool to prevent projection loops contending with API traffic.

Per node: ~25 connections. Active/standby pair: ~50 connections. Add 10 per fc-outbox-processor instance, 5 per fc-router instance (which only opens connections to Redis, not Postgres directly). So `max_connections = 200` accommodates roughly 4-8 platform nodes + outbox sidecars. Bump it as you scale; AWS RDS has a `max_connections` derived from instance class that you may need to override via parameter group.

## Credential management

Three modes, see [configuration.md](configuration.md#database). For production we recommend **AWS Secrets Manager mode** with RDS-managed rotation:

1. Create the RDS instance with a Secrets Manager-managed master password.
2. Create a separate application user (don't use the master).
3. Create a Secrets Manager secret for the app user, enable rotation.
4. Set `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_SECRET_ARN` on the platform processes.
5. The platform's `AwsSecretProvider` polls the secret every `DB_SECRET_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS` (default 5 min) and swaps the pool's `connect_options` when the password changes.

A few caveats:

- **Every `PgPool` needs the refresh task registered.** The main pool registers it automatically when `secret_provider` is set in `resolve_database_url`. The stream-processor pool gets it registered in `spawn_stream_processor`. If you add a new dedicated pool, register it: `fc_platform::shared::database::start_secret_refresh(provider, pool, url, interval)`. Otherwise rotation will kill that pool silently while the others keep working.
- **The refresh polls the secret; it doesn't subscribe.** Worst-case 5 minutes between rotation and our pool picking it up. Existing connections continue to work until they're closed (postgres doesn't enforce password on existing sessions). New connections opened after rotation but before refresh will fail with auth errors — the pool will retry until refresh catches up.
- **Rotation strategy.** RDS's "single-user" rotation is the safest model. Multi-user is fine but adds complexity (the app user identity changes across rotations).

See [secrets-and-rotation.md](secrets-and-rotation.md) for the broader picture.

## Migrations

`migrations/` directory at the repo root. Run automatically by `shared/database.rs::run_migrations` at every startup, in order. Tracked in `_schema_migrations` (id, name, applied_at, checksum).

### The cardinal rule

**Never edit a shipped migration.** The runner stores a sha256 of each migration's content. If you edit a migration that's already been applied somewhere:

- The runner detects the drift via checksum mismatch.
- It does **not** re-run the SQL — that would be silent data loss.
- It logs a WARN visible in the startup output:

```
WARN  Migration content changed since it was applied. The new SQL has NOT
been executed — migrations are immutable once shipped. If you intended a
schema change, write a new migration. If the edit was benign (e.g.
comment-only) you can silence this warning with:
UPDATE _schema_migrations SET checksum = '<current>' WHERE migration_id = '<id>';
```

The warning is informational, not fatal — the bad outcome is silent drift, not refused deployment. For an intentional schema change, write a new migration: `NNN_alter_<table>_<change>.sql` with `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ...`.

### Partition-key constraint

Seven tables are RANGE-partitioned on `created_at`:

```
msg_events
msg_events_read
msg_dispatch_jobs
msg_dispatch_jobs_read
msg_dispatch_job_attempts
msg_scheduled_job_instances
msg_scheduled_job_instance_logs
```

Postgres rejects UNIQUE constraints / PRIMARY KEYs on partitioned tables that don't include the partition key. So every UNIQUE on these tables must include `created_at`. The PK on these is `(id, created_at)`, not just `id`.

If you write a migration that adds a UNIQUE on a partitioned table without including `created_at`, the migration will fail at apply time with:

```
ERROR  unique constraint on partitioned table must include all partitioning columns
```

### Manual migration tracker fix

`_schema_migrations` has a `checksum` column. If you intentionally renamed a migration file (e.g. fixing a typo in the name) but didn't change the SQL, you'll trip the drift warning forever. Reset:

```sql
UPDATE _schema_migrations SET checksum = '<new-sha256>' WHERE migration_id = '<id>';
```

The runner emits the expected checksum in its WARN log, so you can copy-paste it.

## Partitioning

Detailed in [../architecture/partitioning.md](../architecture/partitioning.md). Operationally:

- **Forward partitions:** 3 monthly partitions are kept ahead of current month. Created daily by the in-Rust `PartitionManagerService`, gated by the standby leader.
- **Retention:** partitions whose range is older than 90 days get dropped. `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` is O(1) — there's no row-by-row delete pass to compete with ingest I/O.

To change retention in production: edit `bin/fc-server/src/main.rs::spawn_stream_processor`, set `PartitionManagerConfig { retention_days: 180, ... }`. Rebuild and deploy.

Verify partition state manually:

```sql
SELECT child.relname
FROM pg_inherits i
JOIN pg_class p ON i.inhparent = p.oid
JOIN pg_class child ON i.inhrelid = child.oid
WHERE p.relname = 'msg_events'
ORDER BY child.relname;
```

Expect partitions from `(this month - 1)` through `(this month + 3)`.

## Query rules

Three CLAUDE.md rules that matter for ops because violations cause sustained DB load:

1. **No queries in loops.** N+1 patterns destroy throughput. Reviewers catch this in PRs; if you see DB CPU spiking after a deploy and recent changes touched an iteration over results, that's the first place to look.
2. **`fetch_optional` over `fetch_one`.** `fetch_one` panics on empty result. If you see "stream of restart logs" without a clear cause, panic on an unwrap is the candidate. Grep the codebase for `.fetch_one` to spot risks.
3. **Shallow queries for list endpoints.** A "list clients" dropdown that hydrates connections, subscriptions, and event types per client will choke on a large tenant. The `*_shallow()` repository methods exist for this; they should be used wherever the consumer only needs id + name.

---

## Read replicas

Not required, not currently used in production. The CQRS projection model means the API reads from `*_read` tables that are tuned for query workload (lots of indexes); the write tables stay lean.

If you do introduce a read replica, the natural seam is the API tier reading from the replica (with replication lag accepted) while the scheduler/stream/router continue reading-and-writing the primary. The current code doesn't have a "read pool vs write pool" distinction, but adding one is a few-hour change. The bigger question is whether you actually need it; most deployments don't.

---

## Backup and restore

### Self-hosted

`pg_dump` for logical backups, `pg_basebackup` + WAL archiving for PITR. Standard PG fare.

The platform has **no state outside Postgres** other than:

- JWT signing keys (regenerate or restore from secret store)
- Encryption key `FLOWCATALYST_APP_KEY` (must match — encrypted OIDC client secrets are unrecoverable without it)
- Redis (lock state — re-acquired on restart, no recovery needed)
- SQS in-flight messages (will redeliver on visibility timeout)

So a Postgres restore + matching `FLOWCATALYST_APP_KEY` + JWT keys is a complete restore.

### AWS RDS

Default backups + Point-in-Time Recovery (35-day retention max on RDS). Snapshots before any operation that could lose data (manual schema change, big migration, partition cleanup outside normal cadence).

Encryption keys must be preserved alongside the database. Treating them as a unit prevents the worst-case "we have a snapshot but no app key" scenario.

## Observability

Useful PG-level metrics to watch:

| Metric | Why |
|---|---|
| `pg_stat_database.numbackends` (connections in use) | Pool exhaustion |
| `pg_stat_database.xact_commit / xact_rollback` | Transaction rate |
| `pg_stat_activity.state_change` for long-running queries | Stuck queries |
| `pg_stat_bgwriter.checkpoints_*` | WAL pressure |
| Replication lag (if replica) | Read-staleness |
| Disk used | Trending vs partition retention |

The platform itself exposes a number of Postgres-touching metrics:

| Metric | Source |
|---|---|
| `fc_stream_events_projected_total` | event projection throughput |
| `fc_stream_dispatch_jobs_projected_total` | dispatch-job projection throughput |
| `fc_stream_events_fanned_out_total` | fan-out throughput |
| `fc_scheduler_jobs_polled_total` | scheduler poll throughput |
| `fc_scheduler_jobs_queued_total` | scheduler publish throughput |
| `fc_scheduler_pending_jobs` | depth of PENDING (gauge) |
| `fc_scheduler_queued_jobs` | depth of QUEUED (gauge) |
| `fc_scheduler_stale_jobs_recovered_total` | recovery firings (should usually be 0) |

If `fc_scheduler_pending_jobs` grows unboundedly: dispatcher is slow or stuck.
If `fc_scheduler_stale_jobs_recovered_total` increments routinely: the router isn't completing dispatches within the 15-minute window — investigate.
If `fc_stream_events_fanned_out_total` lags `fc_events_received_total`: fan-out is starving.
