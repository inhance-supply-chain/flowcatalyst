# `fc-dev` — Developer CLI

`fc-dev` is the all-in-one developer binary for FlowCatalyst. One executable
contains the platform API, message router (with an embedded SQLite queue),
scheduler, stream processor, frontend, and — optionally — an embedded
PostgreSQL. It also bundles utilities for bootstrapping a fresh project,
resetting the database, running the MCP server, and polling an external
app's outbox.

This page is the **complete CLI reference**. If you're just trying to get
started, the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) covers the five-minute path.

## Why is it called `fc-dev` and not `fc`?

We considered `fc` and `fcdev`. `fc-dev` wins by elimination:

- **`fc` is a POSIX shell builtin.** Bash, zsh, and dash all reserve `fc` for
  recalling and editing history (`fc -l`, `fc -e $EDITOR`). Shell builtins
  shadow PATH binaries, so `fc poll …` would silently invoke the history
  builtin and either error or do something unexpected. Users would need
  `command fc …` or an absolute path to reach our binary. Unworkable.
- **`fc.exe` ships with Windows.** It's the legacy *File Compare* tool, in
  `C:\Windows\System32`. Even users who never type it would see their IT
  department flag the collision.
- **`fcdev` (no hyphen) avoids both collisions** but breaks the workspace's
  `fc-` prefix convention (`fc-server`, `fc-router`, `fc-platform-server`,
  `fc-stream-processor`, `fc-outbox-processor`, `fc-mcp-server`). Renaming
  one binary without renaming the family is inconsistent; renaming the
  family is churn without benefit.

So: keep `fc-dev`. The hyphen is load-bearing.

## Subcommand map

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `fc-dev` (bare) / `fc-dev start` | Run the dev monolith — API, router, scheduler, stream, frontend, embedded PG. |
| `fc-dev init` | Bootstrap a fresh local app: admin user, client, application, service account, `.env`. |
| `fc-dev fresh` | TRUNCATE every FlowCatalyst-owned table in the DB (keeps schema). |
| `fc-dev outbox poll` | Standalone outbox poller. Polls an external app's `outbox_messages` Postgres and forwards to a platform API. |
| `fc-dev mcp` | Read-only MCP server for LLM clients (stdio or HTTP). |
| `fc-dev upgrade` | Replace the running binary with the latest GitHub release. |

`fc-dev --help` and `fc-dev <subcommand> --help` are authoritative for
exact flags and env vars — this page summarises the intent.

## `fc-dev` / `fc-dev start` — run the dev monolith

```sh
fc-dev                              # default: embedded PG, API :8080, metrics :9090
fc-dev --api-port 3000              # change the API port
FC_API_PORT=3000 fc-dev             # equivalent via env
fc-dev --reset-db                   # wipe embedded PG data dir and start fresh
fc-dev --embedded-db=false \        # connect to external Postgres instead
       --database-url postgresql://localhost:5432/flowcatalyst
```

What it does on first run:

1. Downloads an embedded Postgres binary to
   `~/.cache/flowcatalyst-dev/pgdata/` (~80 MB, one-time).
2. Runs migrations.
3. Seeds built-in roles, the `platform` application, default processes.
4. Starts the API on `http://localhost:8080`, metrics on
   `http://localhost:9090/metrics`, frontend served from the same port as
   the API.

Optional toggles for the embedded outbox processor and scheduler:

```sh
FC_SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true   # default true — polls PENDING jobs
FC_OUTBOX_ENABLED=true      # default false — embedded outbox processor
FC_OUTBOX_DB_URL=...        # if outbox enabled, where its outbox table lives
```

The embedded outbox processor is for the case where your *app* shares
fc-dev's embedded Postgres (i.e. the same database holds both your app
data and the outbox table). When your app is on a separate database
(e.g. Docker PostGIS, see below), use `fc-dev outbox poll` instead.

### Key flags

| Flag / env | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `--api-port` / `FC_API_PORT` | `8080` | API + frontend port |
| `--metrics-port` / `FC_METRICS_PORT` | `9090` | Prometheus + `/health` |
| `--database-url` / `FC_DATABASE_URL` | embedded PG URL | Postgres connection |
| `--embedded-db` / `FC_EMBEDDED_DB` | `true` | Start bundled PG vs. use `--database-url` |
| `--reset-db` / `FC_RESET_DB` | `false` | Wipe `~/.cache/flowcatalyst-dev/pgdata/` first |
| `--pool-concurrency` / `FC_POOL_CONCURRENCY` | `10` | Default router pool concurrency |
| `--scheduler-enabled` / `FC_SCHEDULER_ENABLED` | `true` | Dispatch scheduler |
| `--outbox-enabled` / `FC_OUTBOX_ENABLED` | `false` | Embedded outbox processor |

## `fc-dev init` — bootstrap a fresh app

Interactive bootstrap that produces everything a new application needs to
publish events: anchor admin (if none exists yet), Default Client,
Application, Service Account, `client_credentials` OAuth client, and a
`.env` written into the target project root.

```sh
cd ~/code/my-new-app
fc-dev init
```

Interactive prompts cover the application code, name, type, optional
description, and admin email/password (only prompted if no anchor admin
exists yet). Pass flags to skip prompts:

```sh
fc-dev init --yes \
  --code orders \
  --name "Orders" \
  --app-type APPLICATION \
  --admin-email me@example.com \
  --admin-password 's0me-pw'
```

Writes `{root}/.env` with `FLOWCATALYST_BASE_URL`, `FLOWCATALYST_APP_CODE`,
`FLOWCATALYST_CLIENT_ID`, `FLOWCATALYST_CLIENT_SECRET`. Existing keys are
updated in place; new keys are appended.

Idempotent. Re-running picks up existing rows where they exist and only
creates what's missing.

---

## `fc-dev fresh` — truncate every FC table

Reset the local database without re-installing or re-migrating. TRUNCATEs
every table whose name starts with `iam_`, `msg_`, `aud_`, `tnt_`,
`oauth_`, `webauthn_`, `outbox_`, or `fc_`. Preserves the schema and the
`_schema_migrations` tracker.

```sh
fc-dev fresh                # interactive confirmation
fc-dev fresh --yes          # skip confirmation (for scripts)
fc-dev fresh --embedded-db=false \
             --database-url postgresql://localhost:5432/flowcatalyst
```

Built-in roles, the `platform` application, and default processes get
re-seeded the next time `fc-dev` starts (those seeders are idempotent).

Local development only — there is no remote mode.

---

## `fc-dev outbox poll` — standalone outbox poller

Poll an external app's `outbox_messages` Postgres table and forward
Events / DispatchJobs / AuditLogs to a FlowCatalyst platform API.

**Use this when your app's database can't be (or shouldn't be) fc-dev's
embedded Postgres.** The headline example: an app that uses PostGIS, which
isn't included in the embedded Postgres bundle — so the app runs against
Docker PostGIS, but you still want fc-dev to play the role of "the
outbox processor sidecar."

This subcommand boots **nothing else**: no embedded Postgres, no platform
API, no queue, no scheduler. Just the outbox processor and an HTTP client.

```sh
fc-dev outbox poll \
  --db-url postgres://user:pass@localhost:5433/myapp \
  --api-url http://localhost:8080 \
  --token "$FC_SERVICE_TOKEN"
```

### Flags

| Flag / env | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `--db-url` / `FC_OUTBOX_DB_URL` | *(required)* | Postgres URL of the app DB owning `outbox_messages` |
| `--api-url` / `FC_OUTBOX_API_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Platform API base URL to forward to |
| `--token` / `FC_OUTBOX_TOKEN` | — | Bearer token for the platform API; required in practice |
| `--poll-interval-ms` / `FC_OUTBOX_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | `1000` | Poll cadence |
| `--max-connections` / `FC_OUTBOX_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `5` | DB pool size |

The DB password is redacted before logging.

### Where the token comes from

The platform API rejects unauthenticated batch ingest. Mint a bearer
token from the target platform's service account
(`client_credentials` grant). `fc-dev init` produces such a service
account; exchange its `clientId` + `clientSecret` for a token via the
target's `POST /oauth/token`:

```sh
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth/token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=$FLOWCATALYST_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=$FLOWCATALYST_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  | jq -r .access_token
```

Tokens are short-lived. In practice you'll either pin them in an env file
and refresh by re-running the curl, or wrap `outbox poll` in a script
that refreshes on startup.

### Why a separate process

This is the same shape as production: in prod, `fc-outbox-processor` runs
as a sidecar per consumer application — one process, one DB, one token.
`fc-dev outbox poll` is the same shape, locally. You can start and stop
it per project without touching the running `fc-dev` instance.

[../architecture/outbox-processor.md](../architecture/outbox-processor.md).

## `fc-dev mcp` — MCP server

Read-only Model Context Protocol server. Lets LLM clients query event
types and subscriptions for code-aware completions.

```sh
fc-dev mcp                       # stdio (for editor integrations)
fc-dev mcp --http                # HTTP server on :3100
fc-dev mcp --http --bind 0.0.0.0:3100
```

Reads `FLOWCATALYST_URL`, `FLOWCATALYST_CLIENT_ID`, and
`FLOWCATALYST_CLIENT_SECRET` from the environment. `fc-dev init` writes
these into your project's `.env`.

For the deep-dive on what MCP can do here, see
[../architecture/shared-crates.md](../architecture/shared-crates.md#fc-mcp).

---

## `fc-dev upgrade` — self-update

Replaces the running binary with the latest GitHub release of `fc-dev`.

```sh
fc-dev upgrade
fc-dev upgrade --check
fc-dev upgrade --force
```

Filters the release feed for `fc-dev/v*` tags (the SDK splits in this
repo also publish tags, so plain "latest" isn't safe). Atomic
rename-then-replace on Windows.

---

## Recipes

### Recipe: vanilla local development

```sh
fc-dev                  # one process, embedded everything
# open http://localhost:8080
```

### Recipe: bootstrap a new app

```sh
cd ~/code/my-new-app
fc-dev init             # interactive — produces .env, admin, app, SA
```

Your SDK reads the resulting `.env` automatically.

### Recipe: reset a wedged local state

```sh
fc-dev fresh            # TRUNCATEs every FC table; preserves schema
# or:
fc-dev --reset-db       # wipes embedded PG data dir entirely (rare)
```

### Recipe: app with PostGIS (or any other extension fc-dev can't bundle)

```sh
# 1. Run your DB out-of-band — e.g. PostGIS in Docker
docker run --name pg-postgis -p 5433:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dev -e POSTGRES_DB=myapp \
  postgis/postgis:16-3.4

# 2. Run fc-dev as normal (uses its own embedded PG for the platform DB)
fc-dev

# 3. In a second terminal, poll your app's outbox and forward to fc-dev
export FC_OUTBOX_DB_URL=postgres://postgres:dev@localhost:5433/myapp
export FC_OUTBOX_TOKEN="$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth/token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=...&client_secret=...' \
  | jq -r .access_token)"

fc-dev outbox poll
```

Why not just point fc-dev at the PostGIS instance with
`--embedded-db=false`? Because fc-dev's own platform tables don't need
PostGIS — only your app does. Splitting them keeps fc-dev's embedded PG
in play (zero-config restart) and matches the production topology where
the platform's DB and the app's DB are separate.

### Recipe: connect fc-dev to a long-running Postgres you already use

If you keep one Postgres around for everything (e.g. your team's
shared dev DB), skip the embedded PG:

```sh
FC_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@db.local:5432/flowcatalyst \
  fc-dev --embedded-db=false
```

### Recipe: drive fc-dev from an editor / agent

```sh
fc-dev mcp                    # stdio — Cursor, Claude Code, etc.
fc-dev mcp --http             # HTTP — generic MCP clients
```

## Environment variables (summary)

The full list lives in `fc-dev <subcommand> --help`. The most common:

| Variable | Default | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `FC_API_PORT` | `8080` | `start` |
| `FC_METRICS_PORT` | `9090` | `start` |
| `FC_DATABASE_URL` | (embedded PG) | `start`, `init`, `fresh` |
| `FC_EMBEDDED_DB` | `true` | `start`, `init`, `fresh` |
| `FC_RESET_DB` | `false` | `start` |
| `FC_SCHEDULER_ENABLED` | `true` | `start` |
| `FC_OUTBOX_ENABLED` | `false` | `start` (embedded outbox) |
| `FC_OUTBOX_DB_URL` | — | `start`, `outbox poll` |
| `FC_OUTBOX_API_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | `outbox poll` |
| `FC_OUTBOX_TOKEN` | — | `outbox poll` |
| `FC_OUTBOX_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | `1000` | `start`, `outbox poll` |
| `FC_DEV_MODE` | `true` (auto-set) | global behaviour gate |
| `FC_STATIC_DIR` | — | `start` — serve frontend from filesystem (live reload) |
| `FC_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` / `FC_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` | `~/.cache/flowcatalyst-dev/jwt-keys/` | `start` |
| `FC_WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` | `localhost` | `start` |
| `FC_WEBAUTHN_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:8080` | `start` |

`fc-dev` honours a project-local `.env.development` (then `.env`) on
startup — useful for pinning per-project overrides without exporting in
your shell.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Most likely cause |
|---|---|
| `fc-dev: command not found` after install | Shell hasn't reloaded — see [INSTALL.md](../../INSTALL.md#troubleshooting) |
| First-run download stuck | The bundled PG binary unpack — wait it out; `~/.cache/flowcatalyst-dev/pgdata/` grows ~200 MB |
| `error: failed to run custom build command for postgresql_embedded` | Building from source behind a proxy; use the release binary instead |
| Outbox poll prints "no token" warning | Set `FC_OUTBOX_TOKEN` — batch endpoints reject unauthenticated requests |
| Outbox poll connects but no items flow | Confirm your app writes to a table the processor recognises (default `outbox_messages`) and at least one row has `status = 1` (PENDING) |
| Embedded PG won't start: "data dir exists" | A previous fc-dev with different settings; `fc-dev --reset-db` wipes the data dir |
