// Sink is the destination for domain events and audit logs. The
// UnitOfWork doesn't know whether events go to outbox_messages (consumer
// apps via outboxpgx.Sink) or directly to msg_events / iam_audit_logs
// (platform code via a platform-specific sink); it just calls into this
// interface inside the transaction it has open.
//
// Implementations:
//   - outboxpgx.Sink — consumer apps; writes to outbox_messages
//     so fc-outbox-processor forwards events to the platform API.
//   - Platform's own sink (in flowcatalyst-go) — writes directly to
//     msg_events and iam_audit_logs. Not part of this SDK.

	// WriteEvent appends the domain event to its destination, using the

	// WriteAudit appends an audit log row for (event, command), using
	// the same open transaction. Implementations may no-op when audit
	// logging is disabled.
