# FlowCatalyst

A multi-tenant event router and webhook delivery platform written in Rust.

Applications publish domain events. Other applications (or yours, or external services) consume them via webhook subscriptions. FlowCatalyst handles routing, FIFO ordering, retry, rate-limiting, circuit breaking, and audit — across multiple tenants — so you don't have to reimplement that machinery in every consumer.

## Quick start

### As a developer publishing events

```sh
# 1. Install fc-dev (the local development binary)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowcatalyst/flowcatalyst/main/install.sh | sh

# 2. Run it
fc-dev

# 3. Open http://localhost:8080
```

Next steps:

- [`docs/developers/quickstart.md`](docs/developers/quickstart.md) — five-minute end-to-end walkthrough.
- [`docs/developers/fc-dev.md`](docs/developers/fc-dev.md) — complete CLI reference: every subcommand (`start`, `init`, `fresh`, `outbox poll`, `mcp`, `upgrade`), every flag, every env var, recipes for external Postgres / PostGIS workflows, plus the rationale for the `fc-dev` name.

### As an operator deploying production

Pick a topology (single instance / active-standby HA / split services), configure env vars, deploy `fc-server` (or the standalone binaries). See [`docs/operations/topologies.md`](docs/operations/topologies.md).

### As an engineer working on FlowCatalyst itself

Read [`docs/architecture/system-overview.md`](docs/architecture/system-overview.md), then drill into the component you're touching. Conventions are in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

## Binaries

| Binary | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `fc-server` | Unified production server — all subsystems toggleable via env vars |
| `fc-platform-server` | Platform REST API only (split topologies) |
| `fc-router` | Standalone SQS consumer + webhook delivery |
| `fc-stream-processor` | Projections, fan-out, partition manager |
| `fc-outbox-processor` | Application-side outbox dispatcher (sidecar) |
| `fc-dev` | Local development monolith with embedded PG + SQLite queue; also bundles `init`, `fresh`, `mcp`, and `outbox poll` subcommands — see [`docs/developers/fc-dev.md`](docs/developers/fc-dev.md) |
| `fc-mcp-server` | Read-only MCP server for LLM clients |

See [`docs/operations/topologies.md`](docs/operations/topologies.md) for which to deploy in which topology.

## Building from source

```sh
# Build everything (debug)
just build

# Release build
just release

# Build a specific binary
just build-server      # fc-server
just build-dev         # fc-dev
just build-router      # fc-router
just build-platform    # fc-platform-server
just build-stream      # fc-stream-processor
just build-outbox      # fc-outbox-processor
```

Local dev with hot-reload:

```sh
just dev               # fc-dev with cargo-watch
just dev-full          # plus the frontend dev server
```

---

## SDK clients

| Language | Location |
|---|---|
| TypeScript / JavaScript | [`clients/typescript-sdk/`](clients/typescript-sdk/) |
| Laravel / PHP | [`clients/laravel-sdk/`](clients/laravel-sdk/) |
| Rust (in-workspace crate) | [`crates/fc-sdk/`](crates/fc-sdk/) |

All SDKs cover the outbox pattern for atomic event publishing, definition syncing for declaring event types and roles, and webhook signature verification.

---

## Technology stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Async runtime | Tokio |
| Web framework | Axum 0.8 |
| Database | PostgreSQL (handwritten SQLx for new code; older SeaORM being phased out) |
| Queue | AWS SQS FIFO (prod), SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL / ActiveMQ / NATS supported |
| Auth | RS256 JWT, OIDC bridge, Argon2id passwords, HMAC webhook signing |
| Caching | DashMap (in-process), Redis (HA leader election) |
| Metrics | Prometheus, HdrHistogram for percentiles |
| Rate limiting | governor (RFC-compliant token bucket) |
| Secrets | AWS Secrets Manager, AWS SSM, Vault, encrypted files |
| Logging | tracing + tracing-subscriber (JSON or text) |
| API docs | utoipa (OpenAPI / Swagger) |

PostgreSQL extensions: **none required**. Partitioning is managed by an in-Rust service (`fc-stream::PartitionManagerService`) — same code in dev and prod, no `pg_partman` or `pg_cron`.
