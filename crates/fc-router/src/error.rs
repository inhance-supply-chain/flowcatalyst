//! Error type for the message router.
//!
//! The router's public functions return [`crate::Result`]
//! (`Result<T, RouterError>`). In practice the router resolves nearly
//! everything as ack/nack at the message layer and logs-and-swallows
//! operational failures, so this enum is deliberately small: one explicit
//! control-flow signal plus the two transport/codec conversions that `?` can
//! produce. Config-sync carries its own typed
//! [`crate::config_sync::ConfigSyncError`].
//!
//! (Earlier this enum had a spread of stringly-typed variants —
//! `Pool(String)`, `Queue(String)`, `PoolNotFound(String)`, … — none of which
//! were ever constructed. They were a transliteration artifact and have been
//! removed; reintroduce a *typed* variant if a real failure path needs one.)
