# FlowCatalyst Rust - Development Guidelines

## HTTP Tier Convention

The platform exposes exactly two programmable tiers and an internal one:

- **`/bff/*`** — frontend-only. Cookie/session auth. Response shapes are tuned
  to screens; callers outside the frontend should not depend on them.
- **`/api/*`** — the single programmable surface for SDKs and external
  consumers. Bearer token auth. Authorization is enforced by **permissions**
  (role/permission checks inside handlers), not by URL tier.
- **`/auth/*`, `/oauth/*`, `/.well-known/*`, `/api/dispatch/*`, `/api/monitoring/*`,
  `/api/me/*`, `/api/public/*`** — platform-owned, do not move.

**There is no `/api/admin/*` or `/api/sdk/*` anymore.** Any write handler under
`/api/*` MUST call an explicit authorization check (`require_anchor`,
`require_permission`, or one of the `can_*` helpers) — because the URL prefix
no longer provides a second line of defense. Missing a permission call on a
write handler is a privilege-escalation bug.

## UoW Invariant (Sealed)

`UseCaseResult::success` is sealed (`pub(in crate::usecase)`). The only code
that can construct a success is `UnitOfWork::commit` / `commit_delete` /
`emit_event` / `commit_all`, plus the `.map()` combinator inside the usecase
module. A use case that tries to `return UseCaseResult::success(event)` without
routing through UoW fails to compile. This is **stronger than the TS runtime
token** — compile-time guaranteed, zero cost.

What this means for every `*UseCase::execute`:
1. The happy path must end in `unit_of_work.commit(...)`, `commit_delete(...)`,
   `emit_event(...)`, or `commit_all(...)` — or in `.map(|_| ...)` chained onto
   one of those.
2. The only other legal tail is `UseCaseResult::failure(...)`.
3. You cannot skip UoW and return a hand-built success. It's a type error.

Aggregates can't persist themselves — `impl Persist<X> for XRepository`
lives on the repository, not on the aggregate. Use cases write via
`unit_of_work.commit(&agg, &*self.repo, event, &command)` (or
`commit_delete`). Direct `repo.insert/update/delete` from a use case body
is forbidden by convention; `tests/uow_convention_test.rs` asserts that
every use case's `execute` body reaches a `unit_of_work.*` call on the
happy path, catching any regressions.

**Consequence:** if you see a write action with no corresponding row in
`msg_events` / `iam_audit_logs`, the bug is almost certainly in the handler
bypassing the use case, not in the use case itself.


## Database Access Rules

### N+1 Query Prevention
Never call a query inside a loop. This is the #1 performance issue in this codebase.

**Banned pattern:**
```rust
for item in items {
    item.children = self.load_children(&item.id).await?; // N queries!
}
```

**Required pattern — batch load with IN clause:**
```rust
let ids: Vec<&str> = items.iter().map(|i| i.id.as_str()).collect();
let all_children = sqlx::query_as::<_, ChildRow>(
    "SELECT * FROM children WHERE parent_id = ANY($1)"
)
.bind(&ids)
.fetch_all(&self.pool).await?;

// Group by parent_id in memory
let mut map: HashMap<String, Vec<Child>> = HashMap::new();
for c in all_children {
    map.entry(c.parent_id.clone()).or_default().push(c.into());
}
```

**For inserts — use UNNEST, not loops:**
```rust
// Bad: N inserts
for item in items { sqlx::query("INSERT...").bind(&item).execute(&pool).await?; }

// Good: 1 insert
sqlx::query("INSERT INTO t (a, b) SELECT * FROM UNNEST($1::text[], $2::text[])")
    .bind(&a_values).bind(&b_values).execute(&pool).await?;
```

### Concurrent Independent Queries
When a handler needs data from multiple tables, use `tokio::try_join!` instead of sequential awaits:
```rust
let (clients, events, pools) = tokio::try_join!(
    repo.find_clients(),
    repo.find_events(),
    repo.find_pools(),
)?;
```

### Prefer `fetch_optional` Over `fetch_one`
`fetch_one` is a runtime panic waiting to happen — treat it like `.unwrap()`. Always use `fetch_optional` and handle `None` unless the query is **mathematically guaranteed** to return a row (e.g., `SELECT COUNT(*)`).

```rust
// Bad: panics at runtime if no rows
let row: (i64,) = sqlx::query_as("SELECT id FROM foo WHERE bar = $1")
    .bind(bar).fetch_one(&pool).await?;

// Good: compile-time safety
let row = sqlx::query_as::<_, (i64,)>("SELECT id FROM foo WHERE bar = $1")
    .bind(bar).fetch_optional(&pool).await?;
match row {
    Some((id,)) => { /* use id */ }
    None => { /* handle missing */ }
}
```

The **only** acceptable use of `fetch_one` is on aggregate queries that always return exactly one row: `SELECT COUNT(*)`, `SELECT MAX(...)`, `SELECT EXISTS(...)`.

### Shallow Queries for Filter/List Endpoints
If a handler only needs a few fields (e.g., id + name for a dropdown), don't load junction tables or child entities. Add a `find_*_shallow()` method that skips hydration.

## SQLx Migration (In Progress)
We are migrating from SeaORM to raw SQLx. New repositories should use `sqlx::PgPool` with handwritten SQL. Pattern:
- Row structs: `#[derive(sqlx::FromRow)]` in the repository file
- Queries: `sqlx::query_as::<_, FooRow>("SELECT ...")` — visible SQL, no ORM magic
- Domain entities stay in `*/entity.rs`, row mapping stays in `*/repository.rs`
- Connection: use `shared::database::create_pool()` for SQLx repos

## Caching
- **Token validation**: `AuthService` caches validated JWT claims (DashMap, 30s TTL)
- **Permission resolution**: `AuthorizationService` caches role→permissions (DashMap, 60s TTL)
- Both caches exist to avoid repeated RSA verification and DB queries on every authenticated request

## Static Asset Serving
Vite hashed assets (`/assets/*`) are served with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`. Non-hashed files (index.html) use default caching with SPA fallback.

## Use Case / Operations Pattern

### UseCase Trait Contract
Every write operation MUST implement the `UseCase` trait, which enforces three steps:
1. **`validate`** — Input validation (field presence, format, length). Return `Ok(())` if none needed.
2. **`authorize`** — Resource-level authorization (ownership, access checks). Return `Ok(())` if none needed.
3. **`execute`** — Business logic: load aggregate, check business rules, build domain event, call `unit_of_work.commit()`.

Handlers call `use_case.run(command, ctx)` which executes validate → authorize → execute in order.

### No Direct DB Writes Outside Operations
All write operations (create, update, delete, state transitions) MUST go through a use case in `*/operations/`.
Handlers (BFF, SDK, admin API) are thin adapters that:
1. Check permissions (role/permission-level authorization)
2. Build a Command from the request DTO
3. Create an `ExecutionContext::from_auth(&auth.0)`
4. Call `use_case.run(command, ctx).await.into_result()?`
5. Convert the result to an HTTP response

**Never call `repo.insert()`, `repo.update()`, or `repo.delete()` directly from a handler.**
The use case layer ensures: validation, authorization, domain events, audit logs, and atomic commits via UnitOfWork.

### Exceptions: Platform Infrastructure Processing
The **only** operations that bypass UseCase/UnitOfWork are the platform's own internal
infrastructure — the machinery that moves messages through the pipeline. These cannot
generate events/audit logs (that would be recursive — a UoW commit emits a domain event,
so creating an event via UoW would mean emitting an event about the event):

- **Event ingest**: `POST /api/events/batch` — stores events received from consumer apps
- **Dispatch job ingest**: `POST /api/dispatch-jobs/batch` — stores dispatch jobs from consumer apps
- **Stream processing**: `events_raw` CQRS projection into `msg_events`
- **Dispatch job delivery lifecycle**: status transitions during webhook delivery (pending → in_progress → success/failed), attempt recording
- **Outbox processing**: polling `outbox_messages` and forwarding to platform API
- **Auth/OIDC token storage**: refresh token, authorization code, OIDC pending-auth
  state, and OIDC login state inserts (`auth/oauth_api.rs`, `auth/auth_api.rs`,
  `auth/oidc_login_api.rs`). These are short-lived session records — wrapping
  them in UoW would emit a domain event per token, swamping the event log on
  every login or token refresh. Login/logout *outcomes* (e.g. `UserLoggedIn`,
  `UserLoggedOut`) ARE emitted via UoW; only the token-row plumbing bypasses.
- **Built-in role seeding**: startup-time hydration of code-defined roles via
  `shared/database.rs::seed_built_in_roles` and `shared/role_sync_service.rs`.
  Bootstrap-only, runs before HTTP serving begins, no executing principal.
- **Scheduled-job firings**: every cron tick (and the dispatcher's status
  transitions during webhook delivery) writes to
  `msg_scheduled_job_instances` directly. The SDK callback paths
  (`POST /api/scheduled-jobs/instances/:id/log`,
  `POST /api/scheduled-jobs/instances/:id/complete`) write to
  `msg_scheduled_job_instance_logs` / update the instance row directly.
  Wrapping any of these in UoW would emit one domain event per firing /
  log line, swamping the event log. The *definitions* (`ScheduledJob`
  CRUD: create / update / pause / resume / archive / delete / sync) DO go
  through UoW with full event + audit. `ScheduledJobFiredManually` is the
  exception that proves the rule: it is the audit record for the human
  action; the instance row inserted alongside is still the infrastructure
  path.

These go directly to the repository. They are the platform's internal plumbing.

Any `createEvent` / `createDispatchJob` code path — SDK, admin UI, internal
caller, reprocessing tool — falls in this category and **must not** be wrapped
in a UseCase. Wrapping them would emit a domain event for every ingested
event/job, which is recursive and swamps the event log.

**Everything else goes through UseCase with domain events + audit logs:**
- All control plane CRUD: Event Types, Subscriptions, Connections, Dispatch Pools, Clients, Principals, Roles, Applications, Service Accounts, Identity Providers, Email Domain Mappings, CORS Origins, Auth Configs
- Human-initiated dispatch job actions: resend, ignore, cancel
- Sync operations (emit a summary event, e.g., `EventTypesSynced`)
- Consumer app operations via SDK (e.g., `ShipOrder`, `CancelOrder`)

### Events vs Audit Logs
Both are generated from the same `UnitOfWork.commit()` call. They are two views of the same fact:
- **Domain Events** — "what happened", consumed by other systems (subscriptions, webhooks). Can be purged after delivery/TTL.
- **Audit Logs** — "who did what, when", consumed by humans (admin UI, compliance). Retained long-term.

All UseCase operations emit both. The UnitOfWork handles this automatically.

### Reads Are Fine in Handlers
Read operations (list, get, filter) can call repositories directly from handlers.
Only writes need the use case layer.

## Layering Rules

The platform has four layers. Code in each layer may only depend on layers
below it. Crossing layers is a bug, even when it compiles.

| Layer | Lives in | Knows about | Does NOT know about |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Handler** (HTTP/route) | `*/api.rs`, `shared/*_api.rs` | HTTP types, DTOs, permission checks | SQL, transactions, database types |
| **Use Case** | `*/operations/*.rs` | Domain entities, repositories (as traits/readers), `UnitOfWork`, domain events | HTTP, SQL strings, transaction types |
| **Domain** | `*/entity.rs`, `*/operations/events.rs` | Plain data, domain invariants, factory/behavior methods | `sqlx`, `Postgres`, `Transaction<'_, _>`, any DB driver |
| **Repository** | `*/repository.rs` | SQL, sqlx types, row structs, transaction handles | HTTP, permissions, domain events |

### Aggregates Don't Persist Themselves

Domain entities (`Principal`, `Client`, `EventType`, …) are pure data + domain
behavior. They **must not**:
- Import `sqlx`, `Postgres`, `Transaction<'_, _>`, or any driver-specific type.
- Contain SQL strings in method bodies.
- Implement a persistence trait that takes a transaction handle.

If you catch yourself writing `impl Persist for Principal`, stop. The correct
shape is `impl Persist<Principal> for PrincipalRepository` — the **repository**
persists the **aggregate**. The aggregate is the thing being written, not the
writer.

This is why the TS version reads cleaner than Rust on the same operation:
TS puts `insert/update/delete` on `PrincipalRepository` and nowhere else;
earlier Rust ports collapsed this into `impl PgPersist for Principal` because
it reduced generic bounds — at the cost of leaking the transaction type into
the domain layer and creating two competing write paths.

### One Write Path Per Aggregate

Every aggregate has exactly one place its rows are written: its repository's
`persist` and `delete` methods. No handler, use case, or service writes to
that aggregate's tables directly. If you need to write to `iam_principals`,
you go through `PrincipalRepository`. Full stop.

The one exception is **platform infrastructure processing** (stream
projections, dispatch lifecycle, outbox polling, `createEvent` /
`createDispatchJob` ingest) — these write directly to `msg_events` /
`msg_dispatch_jobs` / `outbox_messages` without aggregates or use cases.
Those tables don't have aggregates in the DDD sense; they're message
queues and audit streams.

### Transactions Stay in the Persistence Layer

Use cases call `unit_of_work.commit(&aggregate, &*self.repo, event, &command)`
— passing the repository by reference. They never see a `Transaction<'_, _>`
type. The `UnitOfWork` opens the transaction, calls the repository's persist
method, writes the domain event + audit log, commits. If a use case signature
or body mentions a transaction type, something has leaked upward.

The transaction handle is wrapped in a `DbTx<'_>` newtype so that swapping
the underlying driver (or adding a second dev-only backend) only touches the
newtype and its consumers — not every repository method signature.

### Where New Code Goes

Adding a new aggregate? You create, in order:
1. `src/<domain>/entity.rs` — pure Rust structs, no sqlx.
2. `src/<domain>/repository.rs` — `struct <Aggregate>Repository`, row types, all SQL, and `impl Persist<Aggregate> for <Aggregate>Repository`.
3. `src/<domain>/operations/*.rs` — one file per use case. Call `unit_of_work.commit(...)` at the tail.
4. `src/<domain>/api.rs` — HTTP handlers. Permission checks, build Command, call `use_case.run(...)`.

If you find yourself adding SQL anywhere other than `repository.rs` (or one
of the three infrastructure-processing files), you are in the wrong file.

## Permission Check Naming Convention

Authorization checks live in `shared::authorization_service::checks`. The following naming convention applies:

### Existing Functions (do not rename)

| Function | Purpose | HTTP Methods |
|---|---|---|
| `require_anchor(ctx)` | Anchor-only endpoints | Any |
| `is_admin(ctx)` | Requires anchor scope or `ADMIN_ALL` permission | Any |
| `can_read_events(ctx)` | Read events | GET |
| `can_read_events_raw(ctx)` | Read event payloads | GET |
| `can_read_event_types(ctx)` | Read event types | GET |
| `can_create_event_types(ctx)` | Create event types | POST |
| `can_update_event_types(ctx)` | Update event types | PUT/PATCH |
| `can_delete_event_types(ctx)` | Delete event types | DELETE |
| `can_write_event_types(ctx)` | Any write on event types (create/update/delete) | POST/PUT/DELETE |
| `can_read_subscriptions(ctx)` | Read subscriptions | GET |
| `can_create_subscriptions(ctx)` | Create subscriptions | POST |
| `can_update_subscriptions(ctx)` | Update subscriptions | PUT/PATCH |
| `can_delete_subscriptions(ctx)` | Delete subscriptions | DELETE |
| `can_write_subscriptions(ctx)` | Any write on subscriptions | POST/PUT/DELETE |
| `can_read_dispatch_jobs(ctx)` | Read dispatch jobs | GET |
| `can_read_dispatch_jobs_raw(ctx)` | Read dispatch job payloads | GET |
| `can_create_dispatch_jobs(ctx)` | Create dispatch jobs | POST |
| `can_retry_dispatch_jobs(ctx)` | Retry dispatch jobs | POST |
| `can_write_dispatch_jobs(ctx)` | Batch write dispatch jobs | POST |
| `can_write_events(ctx)` | Create/batch events | POST |

### Convention for New Check Functions

- **`can_read_<resource>(ctx)`** — for GET endpoints (list, get by id, filters)
- **`can_read_<resource>_raw(ctx)`** — for GET endpoints that expose sensitive payloads
- **`can_create_<resource>(ctx)`** — for POST endpoints that create a single entity
- **`can_update_<resource>(ctx)`** — for PUT/PATCH endpoints
- **`can_delete_<resource>(ctx)`** — for DELETE endpoints
- **`can_write_<resource>(ctx)`** — for endpoints that accept any write (create, update, or delete); checks if the caller has *any* of the three granular permissions
- **`require_anchor(ctx)`** — for anchor-only endpoints (platform settings, identity providers, etc.)
- **`is_admin(ctx)`** — for endpoints requiring full admin access

### Service-Level Methods on `AuthorizationService`

The `AuthorizationService` struct also provides general-purpose methods:
- `authorize(ctx, permission, client_id)` — check a single permission + optional client access
- `require_anchor(ctx)` — require anchor scope
- `require_permission(ctx, permission)` — require a specific permission string
- `require_client_access(ctx, client_id)` — require access to a specific client

## Frontend UI Conventions

**Tailwind is not installed.** Don't write Tailwind utility classes
(`grid grid-cols-N`, `flex justify-between`, `mb-4`, `text-gray-500`,
`md:col-span-2`, etc.). They silently no-op and you'll ship a layout that
visually flattens — every list page that's tried this has needed a
rewrite. Search the project: `grep -r tailwind` returns nothing.

When building or modifying any frontend page, **mirror the existing list
pages** (`DispatchJobListPage.vue`, `EventListPage.vue`,
`AuditLogListPage.vue`). The conventions are:

- **Layout primitives** — global classes from `frontend/src/style.css`:
  - `page-container` — root `<div>` for every page.
  - `page-header` with `page-title` (h1) and `page-subtitle` (p) — the
    standard header block; right-aligned action buttons sit alongside.
  - `fc-card` — content card wrapper.
- **Filter rows** — scoped `.toolbar` (column flex) wrapping `.filter-row`
  (row flex, `gap: 0.5rem`, `flex-wrap: wrap`). Each filter widget gets
  `class="filter-select"` (min-width via scoped CSS — typically 160–200px).
  Search uses `IconField` + `InputIcon` + `InputText`.
- **Components — PrimeVue, not bare HTML or Tailwind components.**
  `Select` (not `Dropdown`, the renamed v4 form), `MultiSelect`,
  `DataTable` + `Column`, `Button`, `Tag`, `IconField`, `InputText`. They
  are auto-imported via `unplugin-vue-components` (see
  `frontend/components.d.ts`); don't add explicit imports.
- **List state** — use the `useListState` composable
  (`frontend/src/composables/useListState.ts`) for filter + page state
  with URL sync. Use `useReturnTo` for detail-page navigation.
- **Pagination** — `DataTable lazy paginator` with `:rows-per-page-options`
  for offset-paginated lists. **High-volume firehose tables** (events,
  dispatch jobs, debug grids) get `?size=` only and no paginator at all;
  see the per-page Vue files for the size-Select pattern.
- **Scoped CSS for everything else.** Use real scoped CSS classes
  (`.font-mono`, `.text-sm`, `.text-muted`, `.active-flag` etc.) instead
  of inline Tailwind names. Common variables: `var(--text-color-secondary)`
  for muted text, `var(--surface-border)` / `var(--surface-ground)` for
  card chrome.

**Rule of thumb when starting a new page**: open the closest existing list
or detail page, copy its `<template>` + `<style scoped>` skeleton, and
fill in the resource-specific bits. Don't invent layout from scratch —
the visual standard is already in the codebase, and the project ships
with no Tailwind to fall back on if you reach for it by reflex.

## Frontend API Response Handling

Most of our PUT/PATCH update handlers return **`204 No Content`** — no body.
The FE `apiFetch` resolves to `undefined` for 204 responses (see
`frontend/src/api/client.ts`). That means:

```ts
// ❌ wrong — `thing.value` becomes undefined, every `v-if="thing"` flips
// false, and the page flashes "Not Found".
thing.value = await thingsApi.update(id, ...);
```

```ts
// ✅ right — call the void method, then refetch from the source of truth.
await thingsApi.update(id, ...);
await loadThing(id);
```

**Convention checklist when adding/modifying an FE API wrapper:**

- If the backend handler signature is
  `-> Result<StatusCode, …>` returning `NO_CONTENT`, the FE wrapper MUST
  be typed `Promise<void>`. Don't declare it `Promise<Entity>` and let
  the type lie — the bug is invisible until users see a "not found"
  message after a successful save.
- After calling a void API method, **refetch** with `await loadX(id)`
  (or whichever loader the page already has). Don't assign the call's
  result to a reactive ref.
- If the backend should actually be returning the updated entity, fix
  the handler to do so (and update the FE wrapper). Either side is
  valid; mismatched declarations are the bug.

The convention is enforced by
`frontend/tests/conventions/no-void-api-assignment.test.ts`. It scans
`src/pages` and `src/components` for `ref.value = await xxxApi.method(...)`
where `method` is declared `Promise<void>` and fails the build with the
exact file:line. Run with `pnpm test` from `frontend/`.

For genuinely intentional uses (rare), add a trailing
`// fc-api-void: ok` comment on the line to opt out.
